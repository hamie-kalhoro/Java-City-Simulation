# 🏙️ Java City Simulation (Console-Based)

A simple **console-based Java project** that simulates the development of a virtual city using object-oriented principles. Ideal for understanding class structures, object interaction, and simulation logic in a text-based environment.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🏗️ Simulates city development via console
- 🧱 Object-oriented structure using Java classes
- 🔁 City evolution logic over time
- 📦 Modular code design for easy readability

---

## 🖥️ Console Output

This is a **terminal/console-only** application.  
All output (such as city status, buildings, and progression) is shown as **text-based logs** on the command line.  
There is **no graphical interface** involved.
